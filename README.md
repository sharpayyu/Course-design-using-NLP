# Course-design-using-NLP
Designed course curriculum for " Master of Business and Management in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Dataset: 
from Indeed job posting for data scientist (remote) positions

Overview:
In this project, I experimented with natural language processing algorithms and various data processing techniques to extract skills (features) from the job posting dataset. 
Use the skills extracted from job postings as features, and run clustering algorithms to create clusters of skills that can be interpreted as courses, and  
design curriculum accordingly. (please see report for details)

Skills and methods involved:
- data cleaning (text data, NLTK, stopwords, N-grams, etc.)
- data visualization (WordCloud, etc.)
- hierarchical clustering algorithm (distance matrix, dendrogram)
- K mean clustering and elbow method
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
